# InfoTransferRate
Information Transfer can mean just about anything when talking about brains. For the sake of narrowing down this definition, the following will be used: Education-->Courses-->Grades&amp;InfoTransfer

# Intro
Many humans are not very good at timing things. This is attributable to many factors, but one of the main factors is that humans like to have an over-optimistic view of what will happen. How long will it take me to get to class? 10 minutes? Well that's not considering traffic, accidents, conversations, etc. Therefore, I've found it important to keep a log of how fast my information transfer is (I'm definining information transfer as either the storage or creation of information). I've also decided to objectify this measurement because 1) it'll allow me to easily compare my rate calculations and 2) why not.     

Before delving into this subject, I want to state that I know there are multiple ways to define information transfer and I know that my narrowing down isn't...exactly...accurate...but I'm trying to go with as-simple-as-possible so I don't fry my brain in the process of thinking about this. I can't even wrap my mind around how the brain stores information (yea I get the memory encode and storage theories, but how exactly does it work? Would it be possible to recreate a model of the brain's memory-encoding-and-storing algorithms and run that successfully? I don't know of any such model but if you know of one please tell me.
